# Question: Is there a relationship between stadium arrests and victory on the field?
A student in the 2021 Online MSDS program brought forward an interesting dataset.
> To create my visualization and pipeline I used a data set containing arrest information at various NFL stadiums from 2011-2015. I found this data set on The Washington Postâ€™s github account (https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-nfl-arrests).

This data was compiled by Kent Babb and Steven Rich at The Washington Post.
