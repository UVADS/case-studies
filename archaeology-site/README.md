# Question: How many nails
Archaeologists dug test pits in a site. They laid out a grid and the xs in the figure indicate where the test pits were dug. The data set[link](https://github.com/UVADS/case-studies/blob/main/archaeology-site/nails.csv) contains the results of every test pit. It has the number of nails and the grid location.
